## Oscar Bertrand

I recently completed a three month Makers Bootcamp where I studied Ruby & Javascript by building a range of applications and websites. I have a keen eye for detail and excellent problem solving skills and I am adept at learning new concepts at pace. I have a sound understanding of OOP, Agile methodologies and TDD and I want to bring my work ethic and experience to my next role, helping to build outstanding products with clean and well-tested code.

## Skills

#### Analytical skills

Understanding the information critical to decision-makers has been the cornerstone of my approach at Arkera. I was routinely delivering intelligence to sector experts that they cannot find themselves. As the principal analyst at ETFGI, I assembled intelligence which ETF industry professionals relied on to make strategic decisions. I also developed new and innovative reports helping ETFGI expand its core business and bring transparency into the then opaque industry sectors of ESG and Smart Beta ahead of competitors.

#### Communication and collaboration skills

Clearly communicating ideas has been another important aspect of my professional life. I used to write market commentary and data analysis reports that I would then distribute to our clients on a daily/weekly and monthly basis. I would also collaborate with data scientists and engineers to source, process and deliver high quality information critical to decision-makers ahead of competitors.

#### Time management

I used to work under pressure and tight deadlines in order to deliver market reports and analysis. My strong organizational skills allowed me to prioritise work appropriately as well as handle queries from internal and external clients on a daily basis.
